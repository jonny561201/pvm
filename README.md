# Project Purpose #
- Create a simple Python Version Manager
- Allow users to easily switch between multiple versions of Python
- Manage global and local Python versions for projects

# Problems #
- The use of uv on windows is limiting
- I want to avoid using a library to swallow my python commands
- I also want to keep the performance improvements of uv without the env var shims
- I want to avoid the complexity of pyenv
- I want a simple, easy to use tool that does one thing well
